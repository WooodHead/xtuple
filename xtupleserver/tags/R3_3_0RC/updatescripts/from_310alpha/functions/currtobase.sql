-- for currToLocal, currToBase, and currToCurr:
-- the curr_rate column has one more digit of precision than the user typed
-- in so if the metric CurrencyExchangeSense says to show rates as
-- foreign * rate = base, we can show what the user typed without rounding
-- loss. now we have to use the same rate the user sees, so round the
-- curr_rate.  see mantis #3901.
