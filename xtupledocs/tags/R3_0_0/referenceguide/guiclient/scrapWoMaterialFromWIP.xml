            <para>Enter the quantity of top-level finished Items you want to
          scrap. You may scrap top-level Items after they have been received
          into Inventory&mdash;or before. Keep in mind that if you scrap top-level
          Items prior to receiving them, material requirements for those Items
          may or may not have been issued to the Work Order yet. You should
          make any necessary adjustments to account for those requirements.
          For example, you may need to issue the components&mdash;either manually
          or through a material backflush&mdash;and then scrap them
          retroactively.</para>

   <tip>
      <para>Shop Floor Workbench users should only scrap
      top-level Items after they have posted production sufficient to cover
      the scrap quantity. For example, if a user assembles 10 top-level Items
      successfully but significantly damages the 11th, the user should post a
      quantity of 11 produced and then scrap one (i.e., 11 - 1 = 10).</para>

            before they can be scrapped from it. Components are issued to Work
            Orders either manually or through a material backflush.</para>
