  <para>An Item Site identifies and defines the methods and controls used when
  maintaining a given Item within a given Warehouse. To enter a new Item Site

        Item in question whenever quantities are demanded by either Sales
        Orders or Work Orders. For Sales Orders, the "Create Purchase Request"

        <para>The Reorder Level specifies when a Planned Replenishment Order

        Safety Stock falls below the Reorder Level, then a Replenishment Order
        will be created when Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is run. The

        <para>The Order Up To (OUT) Level indicates the level of Planned

  <tip>
    <para>Setting the Order Up To Level to "0" removes any restrictions on

        <para>This is a special setting which regulates the maximum quantity
        for Planned Replenishment Orders when MRP is run. The setting does not
        apply to manual Orders, but to Planned Orders only. When a maximum
        Order quantity is specified, MRP will ignore Order multiples and
        minimum Order specifications&mdash;focusing instead solely on the
        maximum Order setting. For example, if the maximum Order quantity is
        set to 10 and there is demand for 17, then Planned Orders of 10 and 7
        would be generated when MRP is run.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>Setting the maximum order quantity too low has been shown to slow

        Multiple. The other Order Parameters listed below do not apply to

      <term>Group MPS/MRP Orders Every</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the length of a period&mdash;measured in
        days&mdash;within which MPS or MRP Planned Orders will be grouped
        together (i.e, consolidated) to meet scheduled demand for the period.
        This functionality serves to limit the total number of Planned Orders,
        thereby simplifying order processing. For example, to consolidate
        demand for an Item Site into 30-day buckets, set the value to "30."
        When MRP is run, the system will automatically consolidate all demand
        falling within the 30-day horizon into a single Planned Purchase Order
        or Planned Work Order. The grouping of Planned Orders moves forward in
        time, meaning the system will create as many buckets as will fit
        within the cutoff date specified when MRP is run.</para>
        <para>The initial grouping of Planned Orders is handled differently
        than subsequent buckets. The following formula specifies how the date
        range for the initial period is determined:</para>
        <informalexample>

          <para>End Date = Today's Date + Lead Time</para>
          <para>All subsequent periods are determined using the following
          calculations:</para>
          <informalexample>
            <para>Start Date = End Date of Previous Period + 1</para>
            <para>End Date = Start Date of Current Period + Group Value</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the length of the Demand Time Fence by using the arrow
        buttons or manually entering a value up to a maximum of 999. The
        Demand Time Fence (also known as the demand fence) is used by the
        Master Production Scheduling (MPS) system to evaluate when forecasted
        demand (i.e., from Production Plans) should be used in place of actual
        demand (i.e., from Sales Orders)--and vice versa. Measured in days,
        the Demand Time Fence is the period of time extending from the current
        day to the number of days into the future as specified in this field.
        The Demand Time Fence option applies only to those Items which
        currently appear on a released Production Plan. If demand for these
        Items falls within the Demand Time Fence period, then the Forecast
        will be ignored. If demand falls outside the Demand Time Fence, then
        the larger of actual or forecasted demand will be used. MPS responds
        to the demand it locates by creating firm Planned Orders for the
        required quantities.</para>

        <para>Select a number using the arrow buttons, or manually enter a

        specified Item, measured in days. If the Item is a manufactured Item,
        then the Lead Time refers to the production Lead Time. If the Item is
        a purchased Item, then the Lead Time refers to the planning Lead Time.
        The procurement Lead Time for purchased Items is determined on a
        Vendor-by-Vendor basis, using Item Source masters. Material
        Requirements Planning (MRP) will consider Lead Times when calculating
        Planned Order start dates when MRP is run.</para>

        <para>Specify the quantity of Stock for the Item you want to keep in
        Inventory to protect against unplanned, unforeseeable trends in your
        Order forecasts. When Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is run, the
        system considers the Safety Stock value when determining whether to
        create Planned Replenishment Orders. If Planned Availability minus
        Safety Stock is below the Reorder Level, then Planned Orders will be
        created. If not below the Reorder Level, then no Planned Orders will
        be created. The system's calculation effectively creates a buffer
        Inventory (if needed) to handle unexpected fluctuations in demand. If
        you do not want to use the Safety Stock functionality, set the Safety
        Stock value to "0".</para>
