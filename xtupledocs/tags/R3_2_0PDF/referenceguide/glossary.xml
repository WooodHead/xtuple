    <glossdef>
      <para>A method for grouping together Items having similar transaction
      value. Those Items having the greatest transaction value are considered
      Class "A" Items, while those having the least transaction value are
      considered Class "C" Items. The acronym "ABC" stands for activity-based
      costing.</para>

      <para>A type of Calendar consisting of fixed time periods with specific
      dates defining the periods. Distinguished from a relative Calendar,
      whose periods are not fixed but are defined in relation to a point in
      time. The following example illustrates the kind of fixed time period to
      be found in an absolute Calendar: 01/01/2002 to 03/31/2002.</para>

    <glossdef>
      <para>The real-time Cost associated with an Item, including current
      material and production charges. The Actual Cost of an Item may
      fluctuate given changes in the Cost for materials, or other Costs
      related to changes in Bills of Materials or Bills of Operations. The
      Actual Cost provides a current record of charges actually incurred by an
      Item. By comparing the Actual Cost to the Standard Cost, managers can
      determine whether costing and production goals are being met.</para>

      </indexterm>Alias</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>Also known as an "Item Alias," an Alias provides a means for
      cross-referencing internal and external Customer Item information. For
      example, a Customer may refer to an Item by a different Item Number than
      you do. To avoid confusion and to simplify Item lookups you can create
      an Item Alias linking the Customer's external Item Number to your own
      internal Item Number. The Item Alias acts as a substitute or alternate
      identifier. In this way, Items may be located using either internal or
      external Item information. Multiple Aliases can be assigned to one Item,
      allowing you to cross-reference an Item using many different Item
      Numbers.</para>

      Material Requirement, or 2) the quantity is required by an unissued
      Sales Order Line Item. Once either requirement is issued, the quantity
      is no longer considered allocated; instead, the quantity is considered

      <para>A logical Item from which Co-Products and By-Products are

      gravel to produce different sizes of gravel. The Breeder Item's Bill of
      Materials (BOM) defines the inputs in this case raw gravel and the
      outputs are defined on its Breeder BOM (i.e., Small, Medium and Large
      gravel). A Work Order is created for the Breeder Item, but this Item is
      never stocked or produced; again, it is a logical Item. Instead, raw
      gravel is consumed by the Breeder's Work Order, along with labor, and
      the resulting quantities of Co-Products and By-Products are

      <para>The relative load of a resource compared to the desired lead time

      shop with a typical lead time of two weeks that has a milling department
      heavily loaded. Perhaps we have identified milling as our shop\qs
      bottleneck and will use the Buffer Management system to monitor it. The
      capacity buffer would be two-weeks worth of load, meaning that the
      milling department can be loaded with up to two-weeks worth of work
      before it is considered fully-consumed. The capacity buffer size is
      entered as "Max Days Load" by the user when they run the Capacity Buffer
      Status report. When the Buffer column in the display for milling equals
      100 we know it is fully consumed.</para>

      <para>A mechanism for temporarily locking Quantity on Hand values at

      When an Item Site is frozen, any Inventory transactions entered against
      that Item Site including Work Orders will not affect the Quantity on
      Hand for that Item Site. Because of this, Inventory counting can proceed
      using a fixed baseline total. When the Item Site is thawed, any
      post-freeze activity is reconciled, bringing the Quantity on Hand total
      to its correct value. The freezing/thawing mechanism is designed to
      ensure you get accurate Inventory counts without having to shut down
      operations. Term is also applied to Accounting Periods. When an
      Accounting Period is frozen, the Trial Balances for the Period may not

      <para>An Item Type used specifically for make-to-order scenarios where
      simplified production is required. Job Items cannot be maintained in
      Inventory. And they also have no concept of Standard Cost or Cost
      variances. All Costs for Job Items are Actual. The Work Orders which
      create Job Items can only be created via a Sales Order. The Costs for
      job Work Orders are accumulated to WIP, and then transferred directly to
      Cost of Sales when the job is shipped. BOM and BOO Items may be assigned
      to Job items; however, they will not roll up to a Standard Cost for Job
      items.</para>

    <glossdef>
      <para>The Cost used for posting General Ledger transactions. Standard
      Cost is distinguished from Actual Cost in the sense that Standard Cost
      is fixed, whereas Actual Cost is subject to fluctuations arising from
      material or production changes. The two Costs may diverge. However, they
      can be brought back into alignment by posting Actual Cost to Standard.
      Differences between Standard and Actual Costs can be used by managers to
      determine whether costing and production goals are being met.</para>

    <glossdef>
      <para>An accumulation of Items stored in Inventory that act as a hedge
      against demand where the required service time is shorter than a time
      buffer for that Item would allow. For example: If we have a standard
      part that takes two weeks to produce, but which we must be able to ship
      in one day, we would stock that Item to ensure the one-day service
      level. In another case, we may be able to produce the Item in a day, but
      sometimes seasonal load changes result in a production bottleneck where
      the backlog on a critical resource for that Item is greater than a day.
      The stock buffer allows us to continue shipping the Item under those
      circumstances. It is important to note that due dates are irrelevant for
      Orders with stock buffers. The buffer size is determined by the Reorder
      Level at the Item site.</para>

      <para>The Time Fence (also known as the demand fence) is used by the

      demand (i.e., from Production Plans) should be used in place of actual
      demand (i.e., from Sales Orders)and vice versa. Measured in days, the
      Demand Time Fence is the period of time extending from the current day
      to the number of days into the future as specified in this field. The
      Demand Time Fence option applies only to those Items which currently
      appear on a released Production Plan. If demand for these Items falls
      within the Demand Time Fence period, then the Forecast will be ignored.
      If demand falls outside the Demand Time Fence, then the larger of actual
      or forecasted demand will be used. MPS responds to the demand it locates
      by creating firm Planned Orders for the required quantities.</para>
