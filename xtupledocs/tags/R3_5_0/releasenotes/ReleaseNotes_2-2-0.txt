OpenMFG - PostBooks
Version 2.2.0
August 23, 2007
==================================

This is the final release for version 2.2.0 of OpenMFG and PostBooks.
Here are a few of the release highlights:

This is the first full release of PostBooks, the open source
Accounting, ERP, and CRM package based on the OpenMFG ERP suite.

The menu structure of the OpenMFG application has been changed from
previous releases to improve usability. The "Neo" menu structure
can be turned on and off on the User Preferences screen. This option
will be removed in a future release, as we standardize on the "Neo"
style.

The first phase of the API project implements Intelligent Database
Views to simplify importing data for Customers, Quotes, and Sales
Orders.  Voice your opinions about which views should be written
next at http://www.xtuple.org/?q=node/4299

The new inter-warehouse Transfer Order feature allows building
collections of Items to move from one warehouse to another, then
shipping and receiving those collections in the same way Sales and
Purchase Orders are handled.

The CRM module now supports Opportunity Management.

A number of screens now remember column sizes. These same windows
allow the user to select columns to show or hide and remembers which
columns have been hidden.

PLEASE NOTE: The application-based help files have not yet been
updated for the final 2.2.0 release. You can find a partially updated

Release Notes
OpenMFG
Version 2.2.0Beta2
July 13, 2007
==================================

This release contains several additional enhancements over the
previous. The most notable is the menu structure change, which should
be easier for users to understand and navigate. The "Neo" menu
structure can be turned ON/OFF on the User Preferences screen. This
option will be removed in a future release, as we standardize on
the "Neo" style.

The Transfer Order functionality has been expanded to include the
following:

- Shipments By Date display
- Allocations and Quantities on Hand (if the Item Site records exist
  for the destination Warehouse)
- Bar code support for Transfer Orders and Transfer Order Line Items 
  (only used on Issue To Shipping)
- The following screens have also been affected: Issue To Shipping, 
  Maintain Shipping, Recall Orders, Ship Order, Print Packing List, 
  Print Packing List By Ship-Via, Packing List Batch, Print Shipping 
  Form, Enter Order Receipt, Enter Order Item Receipt, Print Labels 
  By Order, and Unposted Order Receipts 


Also, for now, Transfer Orders only support one transit Warehouse.

Some underlying tables have been changed to support Transfer Orders:
sopack, coship, cosmisc, porecv. these have been replaced with pack,
shipitem, shiphead, and recv respectively. These new tables have
additional referential integrity constraints on them. The new tables
are populated as much as possible while still meeting the constraints
from the old tables. The old tables have been renamed
'obsolete_oldname' for reference. To allow existing reports to work,
views have been created with the same names as the old tables but
selecting from the new tables with appropriate filters (e.g. the view
sopack selects the appropriate columns from the pack table and only
rows that apply to sales orders).

Several other changes have been made to speed up and ease the process
flow on the following screens:

- Entering Discounts on the Select Payments screen
- Posting Operations screen
- Creating Credit Memos allows alternate Credit Memo value for Returns 
  on the Uninvoiced Receipts/Returns and Enter Returns screens


==================================

The following features and bug fixes have been added to the application 
since the release of version 2.2.0Beta1:

New features:

* Restructured Menus
* Simplified the application of Discounts during vouchering
* Allowed the user to override the default value when creating Credit 
Memos on Returns of Purchase Orders
* Expedited Post Operations by supporting additional bar code scanning
