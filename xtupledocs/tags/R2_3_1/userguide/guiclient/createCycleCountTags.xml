    </indexterm>Create Cycle Count Tags by Warehouse</title>
  <para>Cycle Count Tags are used to count Inventory on a frequent basis, with
  the rate of frequency defined in the Item Site master. The following
  criteria are used to determine the order in which Cycle Count Tags will be
  created for a specified Warehouse(s):</para>
  <orderedlist continuation="restarts" inheritnum="ignore">
    <listitem>
      <para>The system scans the Item Site masters in the specified
      Warehouse(s), specifically targeting Cycle Count frequency
      settings.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The frequency settings are then compared to the last counted dates
      for each Item Site to determine which Item Sites have last counted dates
      most out of sync with their count frequency rate; Item Sites whose last
      counted dates are most out of sync with their stated frequency rate will
      have Cycle Count Tags created for them first.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>After frequency and last counted date parameters have been
      considered, the Item Site's ABC Class is used&mdash;with A Class Item Sites
      having Cycle Count Tags created first.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Then, finally, Cycle Count Tags are created based on the Item
      Numbers for the Item Sites in ascending order (i.e., 1, 2, 3 ... A, B,
      C).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The total number of Cycle Count Tags to be created is determined
      beforehand.</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>The difference between Cycle Count Tags and Count Tags is that Cycle
  Count Tags are generated dynamically, using the criteria listed above. Count
  Tags are generated manually, on demand.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>To monitor the frequency of Item Site Cycle Counts, view the "Last
    Counted" column in any of the Item Site Reports: by Item, by Class Code,
    etc. The Last Counted date represents the date a Count Tag was last posted
    (not simply issued) for the Item Site.</para>
  </tip>
  <para>To create Cycle Count Tags by Warehouse, select the "Create Cycle
  Count Tags by Warehouse" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <term>Mark Created Count Tag as Priority</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to give priority status to Count Tag. Count Tags marked
        as having priority status are listed first in any prioritized lists.
        For example, priority Count Tags will appear at the top of the Count
        Tag Edit List; whereas, non-priority Count Tags will appear at the
        bottom of the list.</para>

        <para>Select to freeze Inventory. The Quantity on Hand value is not
        updated when a transaction is posted against a frozen Item Site.
        Instead, Inventory transactions are pooled and then posted later when
        the Item Site is unfrozen&mdash;or thawed. The Quantity on Hand is updated
        when the Item Site is thawed. For a detailed explanation of these
        concepts, see <xref linkend="Anchor80983" />.</para>

    <para>When an Item Site is frozen, any Warehouse activity entered against
