  <title>Site Calendar Exceptions</title>
  <para>Site calendar exceptions allow you to define variations from the
  standard work week for a Site(s). For example, you can indicate whether a
  Site will be closed for a company holiday&mdash;or whether extra shifts are
  being added to extend the standard week. The Constraint Management system
  considers calendar exceptions when determining the time buffer status for an
  Item Site. The other planning systems do not currently support calendar
  exceptions.</para>
  <para>To access the master list of calendar exceptions, select the "Site
  Calendar Exceptions" option. The following screen will appear:</para>
