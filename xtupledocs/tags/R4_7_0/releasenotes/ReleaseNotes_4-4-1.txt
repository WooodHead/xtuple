Release Notes
xTuple ERP
Version 4.4.1
May 16, 2014
==================================

These are the release notes for the 4.4.1 Patch Release. Thanks
to all who contributed to make this release possible.

PLEASE NOTE: Beginning with version 4.4.1, we have introduced a 
new naming convention for our upgrade and installation files. The 
new convention stems from our unified build process, which now 
supports both Desktop and Mobile Web installations. In 4.4.1, you 
will see the following new file naming conventions:

OLD				NEW
pb440to441.gz		pb441.gz
dist440to441.gz		dist441.gz
xtmfg-440to441.gz		xtmfg_update441.gz

To summarize:
PostBooks 440 to 441 = pb441.gz
Distribution 440 to 441= dist441.gz
Manufacturing/Enterprise 440 to 441 = dist441.gz & xtmfg_update441.gz

It should also be noted that these upgrades will NOT run on any 
database prior to version 4.4.0. You will need to upgrade to AT LEAST 
4.4.0 before trying to run the new 4.4.1 patch upgrade packages.

ALSO: Mobile-enabled databases are not supported through the 
traditional Desktop update process. Anyone upgrading a mobile-enabled 
database should follow the process described here:

As always, please review the xTuple Compatibility Matrix before
upgrading: http://www.xtuple.org/compatibility-matrix.
