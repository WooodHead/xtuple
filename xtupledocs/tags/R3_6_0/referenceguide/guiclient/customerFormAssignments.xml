  <para>Customer Form assignments are used to specify which printed reports
  you want your Customers to receive. You can make the assignments
  individually by Customer&mdash;or by Customer Type. In the case where more
  than one Form assignment applies to a Customer, the system will always use
  the most specific reference first. For example, a Form assignment for an
  individual Customer is more specific than a Form assignment for an entire
  Customer Type, etc. To access the Customer Form assignments master list,
  select the "Customer Form Assignments" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>
