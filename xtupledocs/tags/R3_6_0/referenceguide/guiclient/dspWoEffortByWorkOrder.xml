  <para>When users post Operations from the Shop Floor Workbench, they have
  the option to post either standard or specified times―and the run time
  recorded will vary depending on the option chosen. The standard times are
  drawn from the Bill of Operations Item definitions. By contrast, the
  specified times are based on the users' clock in/out times (i.e., "effort").
  The specified effort for an Operation may be complicated by the fact that
  users can be clocked into more than one Work Order at a time. In this case,
  the users' effort will be spread across the various Work Orders they have
  clocked into.</para>
  <para>When displaying Time Clock information by Work Order, you are
  presented with the following options:</para>
