  <title>Site Week</title>
  <para>Site weeks are used to define the days of the week when a Site is open
  for business. For example, a production Site may operate from Monday-Friday;
  whereas, the hours for a Shipping Site may also include the weekend. The
  Site week is used by the Constraint Management system when calculating time
  buffers for Item Sites. The Schedule module can also be configured to
  require specific order documents (e.g., Sales Orders, Purchase Orders) to
  honor the Site week calendar. For more information on configuring the
  Schedule module, please see <xref linkend="Section519130" />.</para>
