  <para>Report definitions in xTuple can be customized to meet the needs of
  your business. Adding logos, changing how and what information is displayed
  are all possible. The stock (or standard) xTuple reports are given a grade
  of zero ("0"). Anyone who customizes an xTuple report should know that the
  stock xTuple reports may be updated during database upgrades. Because of
  this, you should be sure to assign a grade greater than zero to any custom
  reports you create&mdash;to clearly distinguish them from stock xTuple
  reports. Doing so will ensure your custom reports are not overwritten during
  upgrades. A report definition may have multiple grades. By default, the
  application uses the report definition with the highest grade.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>The stock xTuple reports are written using Arial and Helvetica
    fonts. These fonts were chosen to try and prevent unpredictable behavior
    caused when xTuple reports are printed on different operating systems. You
    are, of course, free to use other fonts when writing report definitions
    for your own environment.</para>

  <para>To view the master list of available report definitions, select the

  <para>The report definitions master list displays information on all stored
  reports, including report name, report grade, and report description. If the
  report is part of a larger package, the name of the parent package will be
  displayed&mdash;with all the child reports appearing in a nested list below
  it. Select the "Organize By Package" option to see an indented view of the
  reports and the package they belong to.</para>
