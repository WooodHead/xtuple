Release Notes
xTuple ERP
PostBooks, Standard, and Manufacturing Editions
Version 3.3.0Beta3
July 24, 2009
==================================

Following on the heels of our successful Bug Derby (129 issues
resolved-- and congratulations to jstandring for winning the
Dell Netbook!), we are pleased to announce the release of the
third and presumably final Beta in the 3.3.0 release cycle. Beta
testers are encouraged to please continue testing. Let us know if
you find anything!

This is primarly a bug fix release, as we anticipate the 3.3.0
Release Candidate in August. However, users may be particularly
interested in the performance improvements they will see in this
Beta 3 release. Improved performance has emerged as a major
theme in the 3.3.0 cycle. And in this final beta release, users
can expect to find dramatic performance improvements related to
list sorting and other list-related functions thanks to work done
enhancing load performance in the XTreeWidget.
