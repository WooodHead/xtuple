      <term>Account</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select the Account you want to use opposite the P/O Liability
        Clearing Account. When this transaction is posted, the P/O Liability
        Clearing Account will be debited with the distribution amount--and the
        Account you specify will be credited. In this way, you will be sure to
        clear P/O Liability when marking Receipts as invoiced outside of the
        typical vouchering process flow.</para>
