        Order Operations are posted for the specified Operation. Operations
        may be posted using either the Inventory or Production UOM. In
        addition, different Operations in a single Bill of Operations may use
        different Production UOMs. For example, if you are producing soup, you
        might mix the soup in one Operation using UOM = BATCH. But when
        canning the soup, the canning Operation might use UOM = CAN. If you
        post Operations using the Production UOM, the Inventory/Production UOM
        ratio normalizes the posting so that the Inventory impact is recorded
        using the Inventory UOM.</para>

        Standard Costs for manufactured Items, you should specify a per
        quantity which accurately reflects your normal batch size for the
        Operation. Specifying a standard batch size helps ensure your
