   <para>The "Selected Payments" screen displays information
    on all existing selected payments, including Bank Account to be paid from,
    Vendor name, Document Type, Document Number, Invoice Number, Purchase
    Order Number, amount selected for payment, and running total.</para>
   <para>To the far right of the screen, the following
    buttons are available:</para>
   <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
         <term>CLOSE</term>
         <listitem>
            <para>Closes the screen, returning you to the application
          desktop.</para>

      <varlistentry>
         <term>PRINT</term>
         <listitem>

      <varlistentry>
         <term>EDIT</term>
         <listitem>
            <para>Enables you to edit highlighted selected payment. The edit
          screen is the same as that for creating new payment details--except
          that when editing, the fields will contain payment information.
          Double-clicking on a selected payment will also bring you to the
          editing screen.</para>

      <varlistentry>
         <term>CLEAR SELECTION</term>
         <listitem>
            <para>Highlight a selected payment and then select this button to
          clear the selection. Because an Item that has been cleared is no
          longer selected for payment, this option removes the Item from the
          master list of selected payments.</para>
