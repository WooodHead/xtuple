  <title>Batch Manager</title>

  <para>The Batch Manager is an application which connects to
  one or more databases and waits for and then processes batched jobs that
  need to be run. These batched jobs are submitted from various places within
  the application. Often the type of jobs that can be submitted are jobs that
  either take long periods of time to run or jobs that you would want to run
  periodically at a given time. When you submit a job to the Batch Manager,
  you specify a time for the job to start running. This job and others like it
  are stored on the database, waiting for the Batch Manager to process them.
  You can see a list of jobs submitted to the Batch Manager by selecting the
  "Batch Manager" option from the System module.</para>

      <para>For details on installing and setting up the Batch
    Manager at your site, please see the Batch Manager documentation available
    in the Downloads area of the xTuple community website.</para>

   </para>

  <note>
      <para>When a report or other job is submitted to the Batch
    Manager with a scheduled time of ASAP, the Batch Manager sets the
    scheduled time to the current time. However, a job will not necessarily be
    run immediately if it is scheduled for the current time. Any pre-existing
    jobs with scheduled times prior to the current time must be completed
    first. In other words, ASAP jobs will not necessarily be run immediately.
    Previously scheduled jobs will be run first.</para>
