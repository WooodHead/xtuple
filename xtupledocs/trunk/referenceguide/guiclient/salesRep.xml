  <para>When creating a new Sales Rep, you are presented with the following
  options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter a code to identify the Sales Rep. This is the same as the
        Sales Rep's CRM Account Number.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Name</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the full name of the Sales Rep. This is the same as the
        Sales Rep's CRM Account Name.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Active</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select if the Sales Rep is currently active. Not selecting means
        the Sales Rep is inactive.</para>

          <secondary>commission percentages for</secondary>
        </indexterm>Comm. Prcnt</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the commission percentage for the Sales Rep. For example,
        if the commission is to be 5%, enter the value ".05". The commission
        on the Sales Rep record is a default value. When you first associate a
        Sales Rep with a Customer&mdash;or with a Ship-To Address&mdash;the
        system will copy in the commission from the Sales Rep record as a
        convenience. If you later update the commission percentage on a Sales
        Rep record, that update will not recursively update all the commission
        records wherever that Sales Rep is used.</para>
