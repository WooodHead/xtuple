  <para>When creating a new Credit Memo Line Item, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Order #</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Credit Memo number for the current Credit
        Memo.</para>

        Item.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Item Number</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the Item Number of the Item you want to add to the Credit
        Memo. If the Credit Memo is being applied to an Invoice, only those
        Line Items which appeared on the Invoice will be available for
        selection&mdash;that is, if the appropriate setting is selected at the
        system level. Invoices are selected for application by a Credit Memo
        using the "Apply To" feature on the Credit Memo header screen.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <tip>
    <para>The system-level configuration which determines whether Credit Memo
    Items will be restricted to relevant Invoice Items is the setting
    "Restrict Credit Memos to Items that appear on their Apply-To Document."
    Selecting this option narrows the Credit Memo Item selection process to
    only those Items which appeared on the Invoice the Credit Memo is being
    applied to. If not selected, a sold Item master list will appear instead
    when selecting Credit Memo Items for Credit Memos applied to a specific
    Invoice. This setting has no bearing on unapplied Credit Memos.</para>

        <note>
          <para>If the Credit Memo is created from a Return Authorization, the
          quantity returned will be zero on the Credit Memo Item screen.
          Return Authorization returns are handled separately, outside of the
          normal sales Credit Memo Inventory handling process.</para>

      <term>Qty. To Credit</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the quantity of the Item you plan to give the Customer
        credit for. The quantity entered here may equal the quantity returned.
        However, you have the flexibility to credit the Customer for a
        quantity different from the returned quantity. The quantity credited
        is multiplied by the Net Unit Price to determine the amount of the
        credit.</para>

        </indexterm>Net Unit Price</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Net Unit Price to assign the quantity being
        credited. If the Credit Memo is being applied to a specific Invoice,
        then the system will automatically enter the Item's Net Unit Price as
        it appeared on the referring Invoice. If no Invoice is being
        applied-to, then select the appropriate Net Unit Price from the Price
        list, using the browse button located to the right of the
        field.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <tip>
    <para>If there is only one Unit Price available for the Item, then that
    Price will be entered automatically when you select the browse button
    located to the right of the field.</para>
  </tip>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Extended Price</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Displays the Extended Price. The Extended Price for a Credit
        Memo Item is based on the quantity credited multiplied by the
        Price.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Tax Type</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Tax Type for the Credit Memo Item. By default, the
        Item's Tax Type corresponding to the Credit Memo's Tax Authority will
        be presented here. The link between Tax Types and Tax Authorities is
        made on the Item master. If the Item master does not have a Tax Type
        for the Credit Memo's Tax Authority, then no Tax will be
        charged.</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Tax Code</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the Tax Code to be applied to the Credit Memo Item. By
        default, the Tax Code specified in the Tax Selection matrix will be
        displayed here. For a Tax Code to be used, the matrix must have an
        entry which matches both the Item's Tax Type definition and the Tax
        Authority specified on the Credit Memo header. If no Tax Selection
        match exists, then no Tax Code will be used&mdash;meaning no Tax will be
        charged.</para>
