    <para>The Account Numbers assigned to Cost Categories should not all be

        <note>
          <para>In the case of conflicts between Sales assignments, the system
          by default selects specific assignments before all-inclusive ones.
          For example, if there were a choice between an assignment featuring
          "WHSE-1" as the supplying Site and another featuring "ANY" Site, the
          more-specific "WHSE-1" would be selected.</para>
