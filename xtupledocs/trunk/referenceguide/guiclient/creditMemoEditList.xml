  <para>The Return Edit List displays details on all unposted Returns. The
  display is a nested list, with a plus ("+") sign located to the far left of
  the screen next to each line that may be expanded to lower levels. By
  clicking your mouse on a plus sign, you reveal lower levels of information
  related to the Order.</para>
  <tip>
    <para>If a Billing record displays in red type, this means an Account
    Assignment is missing for the Customer Type in question. To correct the
    problem, check your Sales Account and Accounts Receivable Assignments.
    Once the Assignments are in place, the record will display in black
    type.</para>
