  <para>When you post a Sales Order that has been selected for billing, an
  Invoice is created for that Order. This is the standard flow for creating
  Invoices tied to Sales Orders. However, you also have the option of creating
  miscellaneous Invoices&mdash;that is, Invoices which are not tied to Sales
  Orders. For example, you might use a miscellaneous Invoice to bill for
  non-Inventory Items you have sold. To create a miscellaneous Invoice, select
  the "Create Invoice" option. The following screen will appear:</para>

        shortcut "CTRL + L". Once a Customer Number is entered, the Customer
        name and billing address will display. Select the "?" or "$" symbol to
        view Customer information for the specified Customer. If a Customer's
        credit is "In Good Standing," the button will feature a black question
        mark ("?") icon. If the icon turns to an orange dollar sign ("$"), the
        Customer's credit Status is "On Credit Warning." A red dollar sign
        ("$") indicates the Customer's credit Status is "On Credit
        Hold."</para>
