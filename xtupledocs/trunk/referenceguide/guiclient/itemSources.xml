  <para>The "Item Sources" screen lists all your company's Item Sources. An
  Item Source makes the link between an Item you stock and the Vendor who
  sells it to you. You must define Item Sources to take advantage of many of
  xTuple's purchasing features―including Purchase Requests, Drop Shipping, and
  releasing Planned Orders from the Schedule Module. In addition to providing
  the complete list of Item Sources, this screen can also be used to build
  detailed Item Source reports. Use the search filter options to sort the
  information into Item Source categories you want to look at.</para>
  <para>Here are some tips for using this screen:</para>

      <para>Don't confuse Item Sites and Item Sources. An Item Site links an
      Item to the Site where it is located in your Inventory. Item Sources, on
      the other hand, define the relationship between your Items and the
      Vendor who sells them to you.</para>
