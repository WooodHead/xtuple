  <note>
    <para>When a Check is created to satisfy an open Payable, the value
    displayed in the amount due column will be adjusted automatically to
    reflect the Check amount. For example, if a Check is issued for the full
    amount due, the value in the amount due column will adjust to "0". Once a
    Check for the full amount is posted, the open Payable will be removed
    from the Select Payments list altogether.</para>

  </note>
  <tip>
    <para>Be alert to negative balances in the amount due column. A negative

    superfluous Checks.</para>
