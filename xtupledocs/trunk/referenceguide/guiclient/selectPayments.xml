  <para>Before you can pay a Vendor an amount due, you must first approve the
  relevant open Payable(s) for payment. Open Payables are generated by the
  posting of Vouchers and miscellaneous Payables Debit Memos. To approve an
  open Payable for payment, choose the "Approve Payments" option. The
  following screen will appear:</para>

    <para>You may approve multiple Vouchers for payment by using the SHIFT or

  <para>When approving open Payables for payment, you are presented with the
  following options:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Vendor</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select all or specific Vendors whose open Payables you want to
        display.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Due Date</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select one of the following display options:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>All</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to show all open Payables for all due dates.</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Older than</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to show open Payables whose due date is older than
              the date entered.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Due between</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Select to show open Payables whose due date falls within a
              specified range.</para>

  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>When a Check is created to satisfy an open Payable, the value
    displayed in the amount due column will be adjusted automatically to
    reflect the Check amount. For example, if a Check is issued for the full
    amount due, the value in the amount due column will adjust to "0". Once a
    Check for the full amount is posted, the open Payable will be removed from
    the Approve Payments list altogether.</para>
  </note>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Open Items</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Display lists open Payables. If a Document is past due or on
        hold, the line for that Document will display in red type.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>Open items may be placed on hold—or reopened— using the right-click
    menu on this screen. When on hold, open items may not be approved for
    payment.</para>
  </note>
  <tip>
    <para>Be alert to negative balances in the amount due column. A negative
    balance indicates that Checks have been issued for more than the amount
    due. To correct this situation, view your Check Run and void any
    superfluous Checks.</para>
  </tip>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use default Bank Account</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the default Bank Account to be used whenever an open
        Payable is approved for payment during the current session. If you
        choose a Bank Account then only the open Payables with the same
        Currency as the Bank Account's Currency are displayed. If you do not
        use this default option, you must specify a Bank Account each time you
        approve an open Payable for payment.</para>

        fully applied—or until there are no more open items for the credit to
        be applied against. This process continues applying all available
        Credit Memos based on their due date.</para>
