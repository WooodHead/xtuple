  <title>Access Control</title>
  <para>Sometimes after restoring a database users get unexpected errors
  relating to permission to modify the data in database tables. This can
  happen even though the user has been granted privileges through the xTuple
  ERP application. Because this screen will be of little value to most users,
  access to this screen is limited to admin users only. To fix access control
  problems, select the "Access Control" option. The following screen will
  appear:</para>
  <para><screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/fixACL.png" />
        </imageobject>
        <caption>Fix Access Control</caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot></para>
  <para>To the far right of the screen, the following buttons are
  available:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>CLOSE</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Closes the screen, returning you to the application
        desktop.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>FIX</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select this button to try to correct database-level permissions
        problems. This will only work if you are logged in as a PostgreSQL
        administrative user.</para>
