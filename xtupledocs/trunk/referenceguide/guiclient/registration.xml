  <para>Users of the commercial editions of xTuple ERP are required to enter a
  license key to verify their registration of the software. This requirement
  does not apply to users of the PostBooks edition. To register your
  commercial installation, select the "Registration" option. The following
  screen will appear:</para>

  <para>When registering your commercial installation, you are presented with
  the following options:</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Registration Key</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter the license key you received from xTuple—or from your
        authorized xTuple solution provider. Once a valid license key has been
        entered, the following information will be displayed:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Customer</term>
            <listitem>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Expiration Date</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Displays the date when your registration expires. Expired
              license keys can be renewed for another term either by
              contacting xTuple or your authorized xTuple solution
              provider.</para>

            <term>Max Concurrent Users</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Displays the maximum number of concurrent xTuple client
              connections you are licensed to have, as per the terms of your
              xTuple license agreement. xTuple client connections are
              connections made from xTuple ERP, xTuple Connect, and/or any
              other xTuple-branded client software. Allowance is also made for
              an equal number of external connections made by non-xTuple
              clients (e.g., pgAdmin, etc.). For example, if you have 10
              licensed users, then you may have at any one time a maximum of
              20 total connections (i.e., 10 xTuple client connections + 10
              external connections). Additional external connections are
              allowed for sites where the xTuple Web Portal is installed. To
              get an accurate view of all your current connections, use the
              following menu path from the graphical xTuple Desktop:
              <guimenu>Window &gt; Desktop &gt; Users Online</guimenu>.</para>
              <important>
                <para>If you are exceeding your maximum number of licensed
                connections, you should arrange to purchase more licenses
                either by contacting xTuple or your authorized xTuple solution
                provider.</para>
