        <para>Highlight a Fiscal Year and then select this button to close the
        Fiscal Year. The act of closing a Fiscal Year causes prompts the

        transfer that balance to the Year End Equity Account defined at the
        system level. You should be careful not to close a Fiscal Year until
        you are certain you are ready to do so.</para>
