  <para>The "Work Order Schedule" screen is an essential workbench where you
  can both view the status of current Work Orders and also perform any work
  that needs to be done on Work Orders.</para>
  <para>Here are some tips for using this screen:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>The following codes describe the various Work Order statuses: Open
      ("O"), Exploded ("E"), Released ("R"), In-Process ("I"), Closed
      ("C").</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>To edit a Work Order after it has been created, use the "Edit W/O"
      option in the right-click menu.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Use the right-click menu to locate any of the actions that can be
      performed on Work Orders.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The start dates and end dates are color-coded for ease of use.
      Both dates will display in red type if the Work Order is not yet
      in-process and is also past due. Once a Work Order's Status is changed
      to in-process ("I"), the start date will automatically revert to black
      type.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>If you use the "Show Only Top Level" search parameter, this refers
      to Work Orders that have not been created to meet the component demands
      of a parent Work Order.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  screen:</para>

  Work Orders. You can build your own search criteria using the following
  options:</para>
