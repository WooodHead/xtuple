        <para>User passwords are established to ensure application and system

        this field does not display the values entered on the screen. Instead,
        individual keystrokes are replaced by asterisks (*) to protect the
        password from being viewed. Once the user's password is entered, it
        can only be reset by an system administrator who must overwrite the
        existing password.</para>

      <term>Use Enhanced Authentication</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select to require users to use enhanced authentication when they
        log in to the application. Enhanced authentication adds a layer to the
        authentication process used to log in to the system. When this feature
        is turned on, user passwords are stored in the database in a modified
        form. The end result is that users may only log in to the database
        using the xTuple Client. If users try to access the database using a
        tool other than an xTuple application, they will not be able to
        connect. User passwords entered when logging in via the xTuple Client
        will not be recognized if the xTuple Client is not used. If enhanced
        authentication is specified for a user, that user must also select the
        "Use Enhanced Authentication" flag in their log in options. If
        enhanced authentication is not specified, users will be permitted to
        log in to the database using database tools other than the xTuple
        Client.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <note>
    <para>The enhanced authentication option will only affect users whose
    passwords are created or updated after the option is enabled/disabled.
    Legacy users will not be affected if the option is not used. Legacy users
    may continue logging in as before this feature was implemented.</para>

      <term>May only use Shop Floor Workbench</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select if you want the user to have access only to the Shop
        Floor Workbench&mdash;and to no other screens. If selected, the Shop
        Floor Workbench will be the only screen the user will have access to
        when they log in to the database. The log in screen for this user will
        be the same as for all users. However, once logged in, the user will
        only be able to see and use the Shop Floor Workbench. This option will
        override any other privileges which may have been assigned previously
        to the user.</para>

        for each subsequent module the user will need access to. All
        application modules are included in the list.</para>

        <note>
          <para>If individual user privileges appear to be disabled, that
          means the user is assigned to a user group. The only way to change
          individual privileges in this case is to remove the user from the
